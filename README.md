# Personalized Password List Generator

Create a targeted password wordlist with patterns and known info.

## Info

People often share too much on scoail media, whether it be their birthday, phone number, or area of birth, all of these little pieces of
information can add up. We can resonably deduce passwords automatically from information such as:

* Their own name or the name of a family member/friend
* Their petâ€™s name
* Their birthday or that of a close relative
* Words related to their hobbies or interests
* Geographical information
* The name of their favorite books or movies
* Idol or important people names. 
* The name of the website the password is for

This program automatically uses the information provided to create a long wordlist of potential passwords which can be used
in a authorized penetration test, or forensic ivestigation to crack any potential passwords.

The creator of this program is in now way responsible for any illegal activity in result of its use, the creator in no way shape or form
authorizes or promoted illegal activity with this program.
