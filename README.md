# Targeted Password Generator
## Information

On social media, people frequently disclose too much information, including their birthday, phone number, and place of birth. These numerous small nuggets of information can pile up. Passwords can be reliably inferred automatically from data like:

* The titles of their favorite books or films
* Names of idols or notable people
* The name of the website for which the password is intended.
* Their own name or a family member's or friend's name
* Their birthday or that of a close relative
* Words related to their hobbies or interests
* Geographic information
* Their petâ€™s name

This tool automatically generates a lengthy wordlist of potential passwords using the supplied data, which may then be used in a legitimate penetration test or forensic investigation to crack any potential passwords.

This program's inventor is not in any way liable for any unlawful action that arises as a result of its use, nor does it support or encourage such behaviour.

### Usage

Be sure to use Python version 3 or higher.

Running this project doesn't require any additional packages.

Start the software using:

> $ python main.py

The password list will be created and saved as "output.txt" in the same folder as the application.
