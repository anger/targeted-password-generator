# Personalized Password List Generator

Create a targeted password wordlist with patterns and known information.

## Info

People often share too much on social media, whether it be their birthday, phone number, or area of birth. All of these little pieces of
Information can add up. We can reasonably deduce passwords automatically from information such as:

* Their own name or a family member's or friend's name
* Their petâ€™s name
* Their birthday or that of a close relative
* Words related to their hobbies or interests
* Geographic information
* The titles of their favorite books or films
* Names of idols or notable people
* The name of the website for which the password is intended.

This program automatically uses the information provided to create a long wordlist of potential passwords that can be used
in an authorized penetration test or forensic investigation to crack any potential passwords.

The creator of this program is in no way responsible for any illegal activity that results from its use.
